# Study of Sample Atrributes Used for Genomic Databases Development

Correlations between genotype and tissue-specific gene expression levels will help identify regions of the genome that influence whether and how much a gene is expressed. GTEx helps researchers to understand inherited susceptibility to disease and will be a resource database and tissue bank for many studies in the future.
